Give it any name you like:\r\n  ```\r\n  $ mkdir -p workspace-olibc\r\n  $ workspace-olibc\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Run repo init to bring down the latest version of Repo with all its most recent bug fixes:\r\n  ```\r\n  $ repo init -u https://github.com/olibc/manifest.git\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* To pull down files to your working directory from the repositories as specified in the default manifest, run\r\n  ```\r\n  $ repo sync\r\n  ```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
