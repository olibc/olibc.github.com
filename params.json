{"name":"olibc","tagline":"Another C Library optimized for Embedded Linux","body":"Introduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe olibc is derived from bionic libc used in Android, which was initially derived from NetBSD libc. The development goal of olibc is expected to merge the enhancements done by several SoC vendors and partners, such as [Qualcomm](http://www.qualcomm.com/), [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/), [Linaro](http://www.linaro.org/), etc., which is known to be the major difference from [glibc](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), [uClibc](http://www.uclibc.org/), and other traditional C library implementations. Typically, the code size of olibc runtime should be about 300 KB. For ARM target, olibc would benefit from ARMv7 specific features like NEON, Thumb-2, VFPv3/VFPv4, and latest compiler optimization techniques. Also, olibc is released under BSD License.\r\n\r\n* Presentation at [Embedded Linux Conference](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference) 2013:\r\n  * [olibc: Another C Library optimized for Embedded Linux](http://www.slideshare.net/jserv/olibc/)\r\n  * Feb 22, 2013\r\n\r\nDownloading the source tree\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nRepo is a tool that makes it easier to work with Git in the context of Android.\r\nFor more information about Repo, see [Version Control](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).\r\n\r\nTo install, initialize, and configure Repo, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n* Make sure you have a bin/ directory in your home directory, and that it is included in your path:\r\n ```\r\n $ mkdir ~/bin\r\n $ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH\r\n ```\r\n\r\n* Download the Repo script and ensure it is executable:\r\n  ```\r\n  $ curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo\r\n  $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nAfter installing Repo, set up your client to access the android source repository:\r\n\r\n* Create an empty directory to hold your working files. Give it any name you like:\r\n  ```\r\n  $ mkdir -p workspace-olibc\r\n  $ cd workspace-olibc\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Run repo init to bring down the latest version of Repo with all its most recent bug fixes:\r\n  ```\r\n  $ repo init -u https://github.com/olibc/manifest.git\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* To pull down files to your working directory from the repositories as specified in the default manifest, run\r\n  ```\r\n  $ repo sync\r\n  ```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
